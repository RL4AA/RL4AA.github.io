Abstract In recent work, it has been shown that reinforcement learning (RL) is capable of solving a variety of problems at sometimes super-human performance levels. But despite continued advances in the field, applying RL to complex real-world control and optimisation problems has proven difficult. In this contribution, we demonstrate how to successfully apply RL to the optimisation of a highly complex real-world machine – specifically a linear particle accelerator – in an only partially observable setting and without requiring training on the real machine.</description></item><item><title>Automated Intensity Optimisation Using Reinforcement Learning at LEIR</title><link>https://RL4aa.github.io/posts/madysa2022automated/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://RL4aa.github.io/posts/madysa2022automated/</guid><description>N.

Abstract High intensities in the Low Energy Ion Ring (LEIR) at CERN are achieved by stacking several multi-turn injec- tions from the pre-accelerator Linac3. Up to seven consec- utive 200 μs long, 200 ms spaced pulses are injected from Linac3 into LEIR. Two inclined septa, one magnetic and one electrostatic, combined with a collapsing horizontal or- bit bump allows a 6-D phase space painting via a linearly ramped mean momentum along the Linac3 pulse and in- jection at high dispersion.</description></item><item><title>First Steps Toward an Autonomous Accelerator, A Common Project Between DESY and KIT</title><link>https://RL4aa.github.io/posts/eichler2021first/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://RL4aa.github.io/posts/eichler2021first/</guid><description>A.

Abstract We propose an approach for incorporating acceleratorphysics models into reinforcement learning agents. The pro-posed approach is based on the Taylor mapping technique forthe simulation of particle dynamics. The resulting computa-tional graph is represented as a polynomial neural networkand embedded into the traditional reinforcement learningagents. The application of the model is demonstrated ina nonlinear simulation model of beam transmission.</description></item><item><title>Toward the Application of Reinforcement Learning to the Intensity Control of a Seeded Free-Electron Laser</title><link>https://RL4aa.github.io/posts/bruchon2019toward/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://RL4aa.github.io/posts/bruchon2019toward/</guid><description>N.

Abstract The optimization of particle accelerators is a challenging task, and many different approaches have been proposed in years, to obtain an optimal tuning of the plant and to keep it optimally tuned despite drifts or disturbances. Indeed, the classical model-free approaches (such as Gradient Ascent or Extremum Seeking algorithms) have intrinsic limitations.</description></item><item><title>Feedback Design for Control of the Micro-Bunching Instability Based on Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://RL4aa.github.io/posts/boltz2019feedback/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://RL4aa.github.io/posts/boltz2019feedback/</guid><description>T.

Abstract The operation of ring-based synchrotron light sourceswith short electron bunches increases the emission of co-herent synchrotron radiation (CSR) in the THz frequencyrange. However, the micro-bunching instability resultingfrom self-interaction of the bunch with its own radiationfield limits stable operation with constant intensity of CSRemission to a particular threshold current.</description></item></channel></rss>
