The RL4AA'25 workshop at &lt;a href="https://desy.de"&gt;DESY&lt;/a&gt; in Hamburg was a blast, and we couldn&amp;rsquo;t be prouder of the community we have brought together! ðŸ˜Š&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s unbelievable that we started just over 2 years ago with 30-ish participants, and this year we hosted our third workshop with almost 80 attendees from all over the world, two brilliant keynotes by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/janrpeters/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BKQY%2BWPKNQ5eDSSubgz3gWA%3D%3D"&gt;Jan Peters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandro-pau-a46916ba/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BKQY%2BWPKNQ5eDSSubgz3gWA%3D%3D"&gt;Alessandro Pau&lt;/a&gt;, and a very well-received hands-on RL challenge, where the competing teams far exceeded our expectations. Various interesting talks, intriguing posters, lab and city tours, as well as social events were also on our schedule.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
