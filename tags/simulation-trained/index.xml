Abstract Online tuning of real-world plants is a complex optimisation problem that continues to require manual intervention by experienced human operators. Autonomous tuning is a rapidly expanding field of research, where learning-based methods, such as Reinforcement Learning-trained Optimisation (RLO) and Bayesian optimisation (BO), hold great promise for achieving outstanding plant performance and reducing tuning times.</description></item><item><title>Learning-based Optimisation of Particle Accelerators Under Partial Observability Without Real-World Training</title><link>https://RL4aa.github.io/posts/publications/kaiser2022learningbased/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://RL4aa.github.io/posts/publications/kaiser2022learningbased/</guid><description>J.

Abstract In recent work, it has been shown that reinforcement learning (RL) is capable of solving a variety of problems at sometimes super-human performance levels. But despite continued advances in the field, applying RL to complex real-world control and optimisation problems has proven difficult. In this contribution, we demonstrate how to successfully apply RL to the optimisation of a highly complex real-world machine – specifically a linear particle accelerator – in an only partially observable setting and without requiring training on the real machine.</description></item></channel></rss>
