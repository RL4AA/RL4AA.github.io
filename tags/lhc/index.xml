Abstract The Beam-Based Feedback System (BBFS) was primarily responsible for correcting the beam energy, orbit and tune in the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). A major code renovation of the BBFS was planned and carried out during the LHC Long Shutdown 2 (LS2). This work consists of an explorative study to solve a beam-based control problem, the tune feedback (QFB), utilising state-of-the-art Reinforcement Learning (RL).</description></item><item><title>Renovation of the beam-based feedback systems in the LHC</title><link>https://RL4aa.github.io/posts/publications/grech2021renovation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://RL4aa.github.io/posts/publications/grech2021renovation/</guid><description>L.

PhD thesis
Abstract The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) is the largest synchrotron built to date, having a circumference of approx- imately 27km. The LHC is able to accelerate two counter-rotating proton and/or heavy-ion beams up to 7 TeV per charge. These highly energetic beams are contained inside a vacuum chamber with an inner diameter of 80 mm by means of strong mag- netic fields produced by superconducting magnets.</description></item></channel></rss>
