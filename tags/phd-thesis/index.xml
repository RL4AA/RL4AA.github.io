Abstract The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) is the largest synchrotron built to date, having a circumference of approx- imately 27km. The LHC is able to accelerate two counter-rotating proton and/or heavy-ion beams up to 7 TeV per charge. These highly energetic beams are contained inside a vacuum chamber with an inner diameter of 80 mm by means of strong mag- netic fields produced by superconducting magnets.</description></item><item><title>Feasibility Investigation on Several Reinforcement Learning Techniques to Improve the Performance of the FERMI Free-Electron Laser</title><link>https://RL4aa.github.io/posts/publications/bruchon2021feasiblity/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://RL4aa.github.io/posts/publications/bruchon2021feasiblity/</guid><description>N.

Abstract The research carried out in particle accelerator facilities does not concern only particle and condensed matter physics, although these are the main topics covered in the field. Indeed, since a particle accelerator is composed of many different sub-systems, its proper functioning depends both on each of these parts and their interconnection. It follows that the study, implementation, and improvement of the various sub-systems are fundamental points of investigation too.</description></item><item><title>Neural Networks for Modeling and Control of Particle Accelerators</title><link>https://RL4aa.github.io/posts/publications/edelen2020neural/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://RL4aa.github.io/posts/publications/edelen2020neural/</guid><description>A.

Abstract Charged particle accelerators support a wide variety of scientific, industrial, and medical applications. They range in scale and complexity from systems with just a few components for beam acceleration and manipulation, to large scientific user facilities that span many kilometers and have hundreds-to-thousands of individually-controllable components. Specific operational requirements must be met by adjusting the many controllable variables of the accelerator. Meeting these requirements can be challenging, both in terms of the ability to achieve specific beam quality metrics in a reliable fashion and in terms of the time needed to set up and maintain the optimal operating conditions.</description></item></channel></rss>
