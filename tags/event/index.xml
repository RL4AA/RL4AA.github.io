&lt;p&gt;Following up on the very successful RL4AA'23 workshop in Karlsruhe earlier this year, we are excited to announce the 2nd RL4AA workshop RL4AA'24, which will be held in Salzburg, Austria, from 05 - 07 February 2024. The workshop will be hosted at the &lt;a href="https://www.plus.ac.at/?lang=en"&gt;Paris Lodron University of Salzburg&lt;/a&gt;. We are looking forward to an exciting workshop with many interesting talks and discussions on reinforcement learning for autonomous particle accelerators and hope to see you all in Salzburg!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The 2nd RL4AA workshop 2024 will be held 05 - 07 February 2024 in Salzburg</title><link>https://RL4aa.github.io/posts/announcements/rl4aa24_stay_tuned/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://RL4aa.github.io/posts/announcements/rl4aa24_stay_tuned/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="good-news---save-the-date"&gt;Good News - save the date!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first workshop, RL4AA 2023, was very successful. Because of this, we are hoping to hold the 2nd RL4AA workshop in spring 2024 in Salzburg, Austria in 05 - 07 February 2024. Further details will follow soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>RL4AA'23: 1st Collaboration Workshop on Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Accelerators</title><link>https://RL4aa.github.io/posts/announcements/rl4aa23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://RL4aa.github.io/posts/announcements/rl4aa23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement learning is the most difficult learning paradigms to understand and to efficiently use, but it holds a lot of promise in the field of accelerator physics.
The applications of reinforcement learning to accelerators today are not very numerous yet, but the interest of the community is growing considerably.
This is how the 1st collaboration workshop on Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Accelerators (RL4AA'23) came to be! The &lt;a href="https://www.ibpt.kit.edu/AI4Accelerators.php"&gt;AI4Accelerators&lt;/a&gt; team organized and hosted the workshop at KIT, gathering colleagues involved in reinforcement learning. The workshop offered introductory lectures to reinforcement learning, a Python tutorial that studied the real deployment of such an algorithm in a real accelerator, and guided discussion sessions on the most pressing topics. The contents of the discussion will be published in the form of proceedings later.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
