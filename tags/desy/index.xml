Abstract In recent work, it has been shown that reinforcement learning (RL) is capable of solving a variety of problems at sometimes super-human performance levels. But despite continued advances in the field, applying RL to complex real-world control and optimisation problems has proven difficult. In this contribution, we demonstrate how to successfully apply RL to the optimisation of a highly complex real-world machine – specifically a linear particle accelerator – in an only partially observable setting and without requiring training on the real machine.</description></item><item><title>Physics-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Control</title><link>https://RL4aa.github.io/posts/publications/ivanov2021physicsenhanced/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://RL4aa.github.io/posts/publications/ivanov2021physicsenhanced/</guid><description>A.

Abstract We propose an approach for incorporating acceleratorphysics models into reinforcement learning agents. The proposed approach is based on the Taylor mapping technique for the simulation of particle dynamics. The resulting computational graph is represented as a polynomial neural network and embedded into the traditional reinforcement learning agents. The application of the model is demonstrated in a nonlinear simulation model of beam transmission.</description></item></channel></rss>
