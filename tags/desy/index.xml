Abstract In recent work, it has been shown that reinforcement learning (RL) is capable of solving a variety of problems at sometimes super-human performance levels. But despite continued advances in the field, applying RL to complex real-world control and optimisation problems has proven difficult. In this contribution, we demonstrate how to successfully apply RL to the optimisation of a highly complex real-world machine – specifically a linear particle accelerator – in an only partially observable setting and without requiring training on the real machine.</description></item><item><title>Physics-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Control</title><link>https://RL4aa.github.io/posts/publications/ivanov2021physicsenhanced/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://RL4aa.github.io/posts/publications/ivanov2021physicsenhanced/</guid><description>A.

Abstract We propose an approach for incorporating acceleratorphysics models into reinforcement learning agents. The pro-posed approach is based on the Taylor mapping technique forthe simulation of particle dynamics. The resulting computa-tional graph is represented as a polynomial neural networkand embedded into the traditional reinforcement learningagents. The application of the model is demonstrated ina nonlinear simulation model of beam transmission.</description></item></channel></rss>
