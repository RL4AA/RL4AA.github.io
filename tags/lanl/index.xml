&lt;h2 id="abstract"&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charged particle accelerators support a wide variety of scientific, industrial, and medical applications. They range in scale and complexity from systems with just a few components for beam acceleration and manipulation, to large scientific user facilities that span many kilometers and have hundreds-to-thousands of individually-controllable components. Specific operational requirements must be met by adjusting the many controllable variables of the accelerator. Meeting these requirements can be challenging, both in terms of the ability to achieve specific beam quality metrics in a reliable fashion and in terms of the time needed to set up and maintain the optimal operating conditions. One avenue toward addressing this challenge is to incorporate techniques from the fields of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) into the way particle accelerators are modeled and controlled. While many promising approaches within AI/ML could beused for particle accelerators, this dissertation focuses on approaches based on neural networks. Neural networks are particularly well-suited to modeling, control, and diagnostic analysis of non-linear systems, as well as systems with large parameter spaces. They are also very appealing for their ability to process high-dimensional data types, such as images and time series (both of which are ubiquitous in particle accelerators). In this work, key studies that demonstrated the potential utility of modern neural network-based approaches to modeling and control of particle accelerators are presented. The context for this work is important: at the start of this work in 2012, there was little interest in AI/ML in the particle accelerator community, and many of the advances in neural networks and deep learning that enabled its present success had not yet been made at that time. As such, this work was both an exploration of possible application areas and a generator of initial demonstrations in these areas, including some of the first applications of modern deep neural networks in particle accelerators.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Using a neural network control policy for rapid switching between beam parameters in an FEL</title><link>https://RL4aa.github.io/posts/publications/edelen2017using/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://RL4aa.github.io/posts/publications/edelen2017using/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.

&lt;p&gt;Free Electron Laser (FEL) facilities often must accommodate requests for a varietyof electron beam parameters in order to supply scientific users with appropriatephoton beam characteristics. This usually requires skilled human operators to tunethe machine. In principle, a neural network control policy that is trained on a broadrange of machine operating states could be used to quickly switch between theserequests without substantial need for human intervention. We present preliminaryresults from an ongoing simulation study in which a neural network control policyis investigated for rapid switching between beam parameters in a compact THzFEL that exhibits nonlinear electron beam dynamics. To accomplish this, we firsttrain a feed-forward neural network to mimic a physics-based simulation of theFEL. We then train a neural network control policy by first pre-training it as aninverse model (using supervised learning with a subset of the simulation data) andthen training it more extensively with reinforcement learning. In this case, thereinforcement learning component consists of letting the policy network interactwith the learned system model and backpropagating the cost through the modelnetwork to the controller network.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
