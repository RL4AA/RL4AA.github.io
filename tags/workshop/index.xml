With over 50 participants from more than 10 different countries, we are excited to see that our community is growing and that the interest in reinforcement learning (for particle accelerators) is increasing. In a total of 19 talks, we got to hear about the latest developments and impressive results in the field.</description></item><item><title>RL4AA'24 call for abstracts extended to 5 January.

To be held 2 - 4 April 2025 at DESY in Hamburg, Germany. Following the very successful RL4AA'23 and RL4AA'24 workshops, the goal of this workshop is to exchange experiences and ideas about RL in the context of particle accelerators amongst both experts and beginners.
We have an exciting workshop program lined up! Two keynotes by RL experts Jan Peters (University of Darmstadt) The second speaker will be announced soon.</description></item><item><title>Registration is now open for RL4AA'24 taking place 05 - 07 February 2024 in Salzburg, Austria</title><link>https://RL4aa.github.io/posts/announcements/rl4aa24_announcement/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://RL4aa.github.io/posts/announcements/rl4aa24_announcement/</guid><description>Announcing RL4AA'24 - Registration is open!

The applications of reinforcement learning to accelerators today are not very numerous yet, but the interest of the community is growing considerably. This is how the 1st collaboration workshop on Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Accelerators (RL4AA'23) came to be! The AI4Accelerators team organized and hosted the workshop at KIT, gathering colleagues involved in reinforcement learning.</description></item></channel></rss>
