Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY. 39th International Conference on Machine Learning.\nAbstract In recent work, it has been shown that reinforcement learning (RL) is capable of solving a variety of problems at sometimes super-human performance levels. But despite continued advances in the field, applying RL to complex real-world control and optimisation problems has proven difficult. In this contribution, we demonstrate how to successfully apply RL to the optimisation of a highly complex real-world machine – specifically a linear particle accelerator – in an only partially observable setting and without requiring training on the real machine. Our method outperforms conventional optimisation algorithms in both the achieved result and time taken as well as already achieving close to human-level performance. We expect that such automation of machine optimisation will push the limits of operability, increase machine availability and lead to a paradigm shift in how such machines are operated, ultimately facilitating advances in a variety of fields, such as science and medicine among many others.\nRead the paper: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/kaiser22a.html\nContact: Jan Kaiser\n","permalink":"https://RL4aa.github.io/posts/kaiser2022learningbased/","summary":"Jan Kaiser, Oliver Stein, Annika Eichler.

University of Trieste. PhD thesis.\nAbstract The research carried out in particle accelerator facilities does not concern only particle and condensed matter physics, although these are the main topics covered in the field. Indeed, since a particle accelerator is composed of many different sub-systems, its proper functioning depends both on each of these parts and their interconnection. It follows that the study, implementation, and improvement of the various sub-systems are fundamental points of investigation too. In particular, an interesting aspect for the automation engineering community is the control of such systems that usually are complex, large, noise-affected, and non-linear.\nThe doctoral project fits into this scope, investigating the introduction of new methods to automatically improve the performance of a specific type of particle accelerators: seeded free-electron lasers. The optimization of such systems is a challenging task, already faced in years by many different approaches in order to find and attain an optimal working point, keeping it optimally tuned despite drift or disturbances. Despite the good results achieved, better ones are always sought for. For this reason, several methods belonging to reinforcement learning, an area of machine learning that is attracting more and more attention in the scientific field, have been applied on FERMI, the free-electron laser facility at Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste. The research activity has been carried out by applying both model-free and model-based techniques belonging to reinforcement learning. Satisfactory preliminary results have been obtained, that present the first step toward a new fully automatic procedure for the alignment of the seed laser to the electron beam.\nIn the meantime, at the Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire, CERN, a similar investigation was ongoing. In the last year of the doctoral course, a collaboration to share the knowledge on the topic took place. Some of the results collected on the largest particle physics laboratory in the world are presented in the doctoral dissertation.\nRead the paper: https://arts.units.it/handle/11368/2982117\nContact: Niky Bruchon\n","permalink":"https://RL4aa.github.io/posts/bruchon2021feasiblity/","summary":"Niky Bruchon.
