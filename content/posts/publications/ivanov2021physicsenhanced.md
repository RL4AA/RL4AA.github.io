## Abstract

We propose an approach for incorporating acceleratorphysics models into reinforcement learning agents. The pro-posed approach is based on the Taylor mapping technique forthe simulation of particle dynamics. The resulting computa-tional graph is represented as a polynomial neural networkand embedded into the traditional reinforcement learningagents. The application of the model is demonstrated ina nonlinear simulation model of beam transmission. Thecomparison of the approach with the traditional numericaloptimization as well as neural networks-based agents demon-strates better convergence of the proposed technique.
