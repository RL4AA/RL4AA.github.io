## Abstract

FEL user facilities often must accommodate requests for a variety of beam parameters. This usually requires skilled operators to tune the machine, reducing the amount of available time for users. In principle, a neural network control policy that is trained on a broad range of operating states could be used to quickly switch between these requests without substantial need for human inter-vention. We present preliminary results from an ongoing study in which a neural network control policy is investi-gated for rapid switching between beam parameters in a compact THz FEL.
