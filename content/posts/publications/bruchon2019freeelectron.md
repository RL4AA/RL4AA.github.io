## Abstract

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of the most promis-ing techniques in Machine Learning because of its modestcomputational requirements with respect to other algorithms.RL uses an agent that takes actions within its environmentto maximize a reward related to the goal it is designed toachieve. We have recently used RL as a model-free approachto improve the performance of the FERMI Free ElectronLaser. A number of machine parameters are adjusted tofind the optimum FEL output in terms of intensity and spec-tral quality. In particular we focus on the problem of thealignment of the seed laser with the electron beam, initiallyusing a simplified model and then applying the developedalgorithm on the real machine. This paper reports the resultsobtained and discusses pros and cons of this approach withplans for future applications.
