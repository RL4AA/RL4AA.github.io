Wow! The RL4AA'25 workshop at [DESY](https://desy.de) in Hamburg was a blast, and we couldn't be prouder of the community we have brought together! ðŸ˜Š

It's unbelievable that we started just over 2 years ago with 30-ish participants, and this year we hosted our third workshop with almost 80 attendees from all over the world, two brilliant keynotes by [Jan Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/janrpeters/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BKQY%2BWPKNQ5eDSSubgz3gWA%3D%3D) and [Alessandro Pau](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandro-pau-a46916ba/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BKQY%2BWPKNQ5eDSSubgz3gWA%3D%3D), and a very well-received hands-on RL challenge, where the competing teams far exceeded our expectations. Various interesting talks, intriguing posters, lab and city tours, as well as social events were also on our schedule.

We learned a great deal from RL experts, accelerator physicists and researchers applying RL to other real world applications like rocket science. ðŸš€

This year's workshop was also partnered with the [5th ICFA MaLAPA Workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1382428/) at [CERN](https://home.cern) the week after. We are also proud to have been able to keep this workshop as accessible as possible without a registration fee for the third time thanks to generous funding.

A huge thank you to all participants from the organising committee [Annika Eichler](https://ai.desy.de/people/eichler.html), [Jan Kaiser](https://jank324.github.io/), [Christian Hespe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-hespe/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BKQY%2BWPKNQ5eDSSubgz3gWA%3D%3D), [Simon Hirlaender](https://mathphyssim.github.io/), [Andrea Santamaria Garcia](https://ansantam.github.io/), [Chenran Xu](https://cr-xu.github.io/) and [Borja Rodriguez Mateos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/borja-rodriguez-mateos-4b0657151/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BKQY%2BWPKNQ5eDSSubgz3gWA%3D%3D)!
