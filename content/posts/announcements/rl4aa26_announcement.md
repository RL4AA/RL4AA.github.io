We are pleased to announce RL4AA'26, the fourth workshop of the series organised by the **[Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Accelerators (RL4AA) Collaboration](https://rl4aa.github.io/)**. After three very successful workshops (**KIT** in 2023, **Salzburg** in 2024, and **DESY** in 2025) RL4AA'26 will be hosted as a **[LIV.INNO](https://livinno.org)** Workshop on Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Accelerators by the University of Liverpool and Cockcroft Institute in the musically iconic port city of Liverpool.

RL4AA brings together the reinforcement learning and accelerator physics communities to share results, practical insights from the field, and the big questions ahead for real-world RL. Expect engaging **keynotes**, **invited and contributed talks**, a lively **poster session**, and a **hands-on coding challenge**.
