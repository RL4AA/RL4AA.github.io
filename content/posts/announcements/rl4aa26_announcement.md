Please join us if you have worked in reinforcement learning or you are simply interested and would like to start! This workshop is intended to foster discussions and to start interesting projects together.

Note also that this year’s workshop is organised in coordination with [5th ICFA Beam Dynamics Mini-Workshop on Machine Learning for Particle Accelerators (MaLAPA)](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1382428/overview) workshop at CERN (8 - 11 April). Both workshops are organised closely following each other such that you can attend both of them.

We highly encourage every participant to submit a poster and share their work with other participants to have a lively exchange!

Do not hesitate to share this invitation with your colleagues and contact the organizers at rl4aa@desy.de for questions.

We are looking forward to seeing you in Hamburg!
