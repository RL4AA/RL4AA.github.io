## Abstract

The optimization of particle accelerators is a challenging task, and many different approaches have been proposed in years, to obtain an optimal tuning of the plant and to keep it optimally tuned despite drifts or disturbances. Indeed, the classical model-free approaches (such as Gradient Ascent or Extremum Seeking algorithms) have intrinsic limitations. To overcome those limitations, Machine Learning techniques, in particular, the Reinforcement Learning, are attracting more and more attention in the particle accelerator community. The purpose of this paper is to apply a Reinforcement Learning model-free approach to the alignment of a seed laser, based on a rather general target function depending on the laser trajectory. The study focuses on the alignment of the lasers at FERMI, the free-electron laser facility at Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste. In particular, we employ Q-learning with linear function approximation and report experimental results obtained in two setups, which are the actual setups where the final application has to be deployed. Despite the simplicity of the approach, we report satisfactory preliminary results, that represent the first step toward a fully automatic procedure for seed laser to the electron beam. Such a superimposition is, at present, performed manually.
